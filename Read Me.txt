Eclipse IDE Assumed (but can also be used with JGrasp - see note at end)

Step 1:

In order to get this application running you need to start mySql Server
and import/restore the database MySQlDataBase.

When restored the datbase will be called farm and shall have a single
table called sheep.

Step 2:

Create a new Project in Eclipse called "Farm" and Drag and drop the two 
Java Source code files into that projects source code package 
(FarmTester.java and Sheep.java).

Step 3:  
Ensure the logon and password are correct for the database. In the java source 
file "Sheep.Java" login is "root" and password is "password". Change the code if
the login does not match your database.


Step 4:
Java requires an ODBC connector jar to connect to the database. The connector 
is "mysql-connector-java-5.1.38-bin.jar". On the context menu of the project 
(right click) choose "properties" and then "Java build path". 
Under Libraries add the jar.

Step 5:
You should now be able to excecute the application "Farmtester.Java"



Note for JGrasp
Place the jar in "jgrasp/extensions/classes"
